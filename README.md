Dual Citizenship Support

Technologies used: REACT + MATERIAL UI

Just a basic landing page for a consulting business.

Fully scalable, the project has been built as a SPA with React.

The design was created with the ease of Material UI and the pages containing the information about the company and its services (not included here) are accessible from both the navbar and the cards below.

Some transitions effects like the automatic scrolling at the click of the arrow and the fading in of the cards make the user experience more pleasant.
